# Automation Testing Project

I developed an automation project using Selenium and Maven to test the 'Automation Exercise' website. The scripts cover login/logout, product purchase, and user account creation followed by deletion, ensuring core user flows are validated effectively.

## Features
- Login/Logout automation
- Product purchase flow
- Account creation and deletion

## How to Run
Clone the repo
Verify maven is installed `mvn -v`
JDK is installed `java -version`
chromedriver is installed `DriverManager.java`
run using maven command `mvn clean test`
run a specific test file `mvn test -Dtest=LoginTest`
